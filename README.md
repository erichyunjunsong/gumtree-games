# Gumtree Games

![GumtreeGamesBanner](GumtreeGamesBanner.png)

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to simplify the process in finding cheap video games on Gumtree. At the moment, the whole process is manual which expends quite a bit of time and effort that is not reflected in the end result.

## Processes

The above process can be broken down into several sub processes.

### Identifying new listings

The first essential process is identifying new listings.

### Looking at the details of the listings

### Evaluating "value" of the listing

This involves me evaluating whether I can resell the games on for a profit, with there being other factors being taken into consideration, such as profit margin and shipping.
